1.	NAT-Network Address Translation
NAT is a method used in networks to translate private IP addresses (used within a local network) into a public IP address (used on the internet), and vice versa.
NAT important    ---------Hides internal IP addresses
		             ---------Limits exposure to the internet
		             ---------Conserves IPv4 addresses
2.	What is a subnet?
A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a smaller, logically divided section of a larger network (like a LAN or the internet). Subnets are created to organize, secure, and efficiently manage IP addresses within a network.
Importance      --------- Improved security
                --------- Access control
		            --------- Containment

3.	What is a Network 
A network is a group of connected computers and devices that can communicate and share resources like files, internet access, printers, etc.
Types-LAN,WAN,MAN,PAN

4.	What is an IP Address?
An IP Address (short for Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or a local network.

5.	What is a MAC ID (or MAC Address)?
MAC stands for Media Access Control. A MAC ID (also called MAC address) is a unique hardware address assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC). 
•	48-bit (6 bytes) address

9.	What is an API? 
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It is a bridge that lets two different software programs talk to each other and share data or functions.
Understanding- You (the user) send a request (menu order), the waiter (API) takes it to the kitchen (server), and brings the food (response) back to you.

10.	Applications and Websites introduced-
•	The Wayback Machine lets you view old versions of websites — as they looked at specific times in the past.
•	A bug bounty app is a platform where ethical hackers (a.k.a. bug bounty hunters) test websites or apps for security flaws, report them, and get paid if the bug is valid.
•	"Have I Been Pwned?" tells you if your personal data (email, password, etc.) was leaked or stolen in known hacks or cyber attacks.

11.	Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanning tool used to discover hosts, services, ports, and vulnerabilities on a network.
