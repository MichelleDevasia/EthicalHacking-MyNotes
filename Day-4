1.	NAT-Network Address Translation
NAT is a method used in networks to translate private IP addresses (used within a local network) into a public IP address (used on the internet), and vice versa.
NAT important    ---------Hides internal IP addresses
		             ---------Limits exposure to the internet
		             ---------Conserves IPv4 addresses
2.	What is a subnet?
A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a smaller, logically divided section of a larger network (like a LAN or the internet). Subnets are created to organize, secure, and efficiently manage IP addresses within a network.
Importance      --------- Improved security
                --------- Access control
		            --------- Containment

3.	What is a Network 
A network is a group of connected computers and devices that can communicate and share resources like files, internet access, printers, etc.
Types-LAN,WAN,MAN,PAN

4.	What is an IP Address?
An IP Address (short for Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet or a local network.

5.	What is a MAC ID (or MAC Address)?

7.
Term	                                             Meaning (Simplified)	                                                                           Example
Port Frequency	                     How often a particular port is scanned or attacked.                                          Port 22 (SSH) is scanned frequently.
                                              High frequency = more targeted.	
Payload	                   The actual malicious content delivered during an attack (virus, script, command).	                    Malware file or reverse shell script.
Backdoor	                           A hidden entry left by an attacker to come back later.                                        	A secret account or open port.
Attack Timeline	                The sequence of steps an attacker follows during the attack.	                                    Info gathering → Exploit → Backdoor.
Information Gathering	          The first step: attacker collects info about system, ports, services.	                                Using tools like Nmap, Whois, etc.

9.	What is an API? 
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It is a bridge that lets two different software programs talk to each other and share data or functions.
Understanding- You (the user) send a request (menu order), the waiter (API) takes it to the kitchen (server), and brings the food (response) back to you.

10.	Applications and Websites introduced-
•	The Wayback Machine lets you view old versions of websites — as they looked at specific times in the past.
•	A bug bounty app is a platform where ethical hackers (a.k.a. bug bounty hunters) test websites or apps for security flaws, report them, and get paid if the bug is valid.
•	"Have I Been Pwned?" tells you if your personal data (email, password, etc.) was leaked or stolen in known hacks or cyber attacks.

11.	Nmap (Network Mapper) is a network scanning tool used to discover hosts, services, ports, and vulnerabilities on a network.
