Cybersecurity - Definition
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks aimed at
accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money, or disrupting operations.

Ways Cybersecurity is Compromised
1. Accessing: Unauthorized entry into systems (e.g., hacking into an account).
2. Changing: Modifying data without permission (e.g., altering medical records).
3. Destroying: Deleting or corrupting data (e.g., ransomware wiping files).
Types of cybersecurity Threats:
Malware – Harmful software like viruses or ransomware that damages or hijacks systems.
E.g., Ransomware locking your files.
Phishing – Fake messages/emails to steal personal data.
E.g., Email pretending to be your bank.
MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) – Attacker secretly intercepts communication.
E.g., Hacking over public Wi-Fi.
DDoS Attack – Overloads a server to make it crash.
E.g., Website down due to too much fake traffic.
SQL Injection – Inserting malicious code into forms to access databases.
E.g., Login bypass using special input.
Zero-Day – Exploiting software bugs before the developer fixes them.
E.g., Attacking a flaw on the day it is discovered.

Red Team (Offensive Security Team)
The red team acts like ethical hackers. Their job is to simulate real-world attacks to test the strength of an organization's defenses. They try to find vulnerabilities by thinking like a hacker.

Blue Team (Defensive Security Team)
The blue team focuses on protecting and defending the organization’s digital infrastructure. They monitor systems, detect threats, respond to incidents, and ensure security policies are in place.

Purple Team (Collaboration Team)
The purple team acts as a bridge between red and blue teams. Their job is to improve overall security by ensuring that attack insights from the red team help the blue team defend better, and that blue team feedback helps the red team test smarter.

Cybersecurity Acronyms and Full Forms
- IDS - Intrusion Detection System
- IPS - Intrusion Prevention System
- POC - Proof of Concept
- SSL - Secure Sockets Layer

What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is a simulated cyberattack performed by ethical hackers to find and fix
vulnerabilities before real attackers can exploit them.
